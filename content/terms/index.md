### Scope
These Terms govern the use of this website as well as consulting services offered by Valentin Pfeil.  
Specific engagements are subject to separate agreements or Statements of Work (SOWs). In case of conflict, the SOW shall prevail.

### Professional Services
Consulting services are delivered based on written SOWs or engagement letters.  
These documents define scope, deliverables, timelines, fees, payment terms, intellectual property, confidentiality and warranties.  
No obligation arises without a signed SOW.

### Intellectual Property
Unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing:  
- Pre-existing intellectual property remains the property of the originating party.  
- Newly created work product will be licensed or assigned as defined in the applicable SOW.  

### Confidentiality
Both parties undertake to treat all non-public information received in the course of an engagement as confidential, using at least a reasonable standard of care.  
Confidentiality obligations survive the termination of the engagement.

### Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, liability is limited to direct damages and capped at the total fees paid for the relevant services.  
Exclusions: this limitation does not apply in cases of wilful misconduct, gross negligence or where mandatory statutory law provides otherwise.

### Governing Law & Venue
These Terms and any disputes arising from them are governed by the laws of Germany.  
Exclusive venue is Munich, unless mandatory statutory provisions dictate otherwise.

### Amendments
We may update these Terms from time to time. The version published on this website at the time of use or engagement shall apply.
