  abstract     = {This thesis investigates the integration of Confidential Computing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments by leveraging hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as AMD SEV-SNP within an OpenStack cloud infrastructure. It analyses how TEEs protect sensitive biomedical and scientific data by ensuring security attestation, data integrity and workload isolation. The study includes deployment automation with Terraform and Ansible, workload orchestration with SLURM and benchmarks with GROMACS simulations to evaluate usability, performance and scalability.}
