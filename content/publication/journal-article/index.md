abstract: >
  This seminar paper explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can serve as a transformative enabler
  for advancing cyber resilience through risk management. It examines the integration of AI techniques
  such as machine learning, natural language processing and generative AI into risk management frameworks
  to anticipate, withstand, recover from and adapt to cyber incidents. The paper evaluates applications
  across critical sectors including healthcare, finance, energy and public administration, while also
  addressing ethical, technical and regulatory challenges such as those posed by the EU AI Act.
  It concludes that aligning AI innovations with standards and ethics is essential to strengthen
  resilience and ensure operational continuity in increasingly hostile digital environments.
