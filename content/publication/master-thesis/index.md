abstract: >
  This thesis designs and evaluates a cloud-native data platform for defence and
  intelligence organisations operating in secure, sovereign or coalition
  environments. The platform targets mission-critical workloads with strict
  confidentiality and integrity requirements and integrates Confidential
  Computing techniques, remote attestation and end-to-end integrity protection.
  A modular microservice architecture, zero-trust principles and policy-driven
  data flows are combined with auditability and provenance tracking to meet
  compliance demands in NATO-aligned settings. The work analyses operational
  constraints, threat models and interoperability requirements and presents a
  reference implementation with automated deployment, attestation pipeline and
  governance controls. Results show that the platform can preserve data
  sovereignty and verifiability while sustaining operational tempo, providing a
  pragmatic blueprint for connected defence missions.
