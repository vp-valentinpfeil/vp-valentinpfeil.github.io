  abstract     = {This thesis designs and evaluates a cloud-native data platform for defence and intelligence organisations operating in secure, sovereign or coalition environments. It integrates Confidential Computing techniques, remote attestation and end-to-end integrity protection within a modular microservice architecture. The platform enables zero-trust principles and policy-driven governance to meet compliance demands in NATO-aligned settings, ensuring operational resilience, auditability and sovereignty of mission-critical workloads.}
