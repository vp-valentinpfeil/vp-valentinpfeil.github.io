abstract: >
  This seminar paper explores the role of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) 
  such as AMD SEV-SNP in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments with a focus on 
  Confidential Computing. It analyses potential benefits for protecting scientific workloads 
  and sensitive data in cloud infrastructures, with emphasis on attestation mechanisms, 
  data isolation and workload integrity. The work provides an early investigation of design 
  trade-offs and forms the foundation for later thesis-level research.

summary: >
  Early evaluation of Confidential Computing in HPC using AMD SEV-SNP, with emphasis 
  on attestation, workload protection and design trade-offs in cloud-based research environments.
