DigiMed Bayern is a Bavarian flagship project for **P4 medicine** (Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, Participatory), funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Health.  
The project combines large-scale patient datasets and multi-omics analyses in a secure, high-performance IT infrastructure for ethically and legally compliant “Big Data” analytics.  
Its mission is to improve disease risk prediction, enable targeted prevention and build a scalable digital platform for healthcare across Bavaria and beyond.
