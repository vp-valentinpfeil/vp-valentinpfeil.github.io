**Confidential Computing via Hardware Trusted Execution Environments by an OpenStack HPC capable Cloud**  
This thesis explored the integration of **AMD SEV-SNP** into OpenStack-based high-performance computing environments.  
It focused on **remote attestation**, security guarantees, usability (frontend and backend) and performance benchmarks with biomedical workloads and the SLURM workload manager.  
The work demonstrated how confidential computing can safeguard sensitive research data while maintaining scalability and efficiency.
