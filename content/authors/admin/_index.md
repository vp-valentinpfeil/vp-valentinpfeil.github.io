## About Me

I support companies **secure** their **cloud** infrastructures and **enable data protection** during use with **confidential computing**.

My focus areas: Trusted Execution Environments (AMD SEV-SNP, AWS Nitro Enclaves, OP-TEE), remote attestation, and vault integrationâ€”for a new level of security for business-critical workloads.
With my dual background as an IT officer in the German Armed Forces and a cloud security consultant, I combine discipline, technical expertise, and compliance knowledge (**ISO 27001**, BSI C5, **NATO D3.2**) to achieve measurable results.

Core competencies: Cloud security architecture (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), Kubernetes and container security, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Helm, Kubectl), IT governance and compliance consulting.
Available part-time for consulting, architecture design, security reviews, and proof-of-concepts in civilian industries such as healthcare, finance and Industry 4.0.

Alongside my work as an officer and IT architect, I am passionate about sport (Hyrox, calisthenics, yoga) and international collaboration.

**My mission:** building Trust in Cloud.
